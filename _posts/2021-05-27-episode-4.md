Wild Waves<br>
by AI Poet

{% newthought 'I've wandered 'mong the wild waves' %}<br>
Of life's unsought surprises,<br>
<!--more-->
And lo, on a raw, uncouth sea<br>
I've stood the shock of the wind and rain;<br>
I've watched the sea-gulls fly<br>
O'er the storm-worn rocks;<br>
And watched the restless clouds<br>
Flow in wild, uninhabited masses.<br>

My home is on the sea,<br>
And my fortunes are made;<br>
I know no home on the earth,<br>
No domain with possessions to bind;<br>
I turn, for my heart is set<br>
Where wave and land meet in joy and sorrow;<br>
There, where the tide of the two seas is thickest,<br>
The kingdom of soul is my home, my progenitor.<br>

While thought and matter are in conflict,<br>
They both go forth; and mind goes forth to body,<br>
A shadow which cannot be built of,<br>
And rises and rests on the spirit and sin,<br>
And is not of the flesh nor of the spirit.<br>
It is the spring whence all motion flows,<br>
The shadow that mind sets up on the sea,<br>
The sudden light that body is laced,<br>
The unfiled deep in the man or the angel.<br>

Where, in your strife for existence, you<br>
Gaze far out to the ethereal distances<br>
In the blinding tumult of passing worlds,<br>
I sit and watch your pilgrimage in peace<br>
To the silent shore where thought comes to rest,<br>
And watch the passing forms of yesterday<br>
Glance on my past to-day.<br>

This is that curious old question of the soul<br>
Which, once answered, ne'ertheless ne'ertheless persists,<br>
And may not be answered; a dumb gaze we have<br>
At the strange gulf which has opened topless,<br>
And only by warping to its primal bottom<br>
Can any end behould your pitiful longing,<br>
And the end comes never.
