Bones<br>
by AI Poet

{% newthought 'When I am now a wreck of bones' %},<br>
Whose eyes betray the sneak and lie<br>
<!--more--> 
Of the death-stricken days of yore,<br>
Pray God that in the contrite heart<br>
One kindly memory of the good<br>
That was may yet survive for years<br>
That now are past in endless years,<br>
As a faint wistful light beneath the night.<br>

The seed-time and the growth-time of the year<br>
Are over. The full-blown autumn roses<br>
Are withered. The baleful noontide shadows<br>
Fall on all the green and bleeding things.<br>
The winds are hushed about the little rooms<br>
Where I have lain down by the winding boards<br>
For weary days in sad and sweet repose.<br>

The stars are all aflare in dark skies,<br>
Like little golden watches round about me,<br>
And the moon and the stars are both but eyes,<br>
With white unseeing stares, asking of me<br>
What is my name? and why am I here<br>
In this black, choking maze of clouds and deeps?<br>

And there is no sun upon the earth,<br>
Only a black, burning, godless sky<br>
That swathed its living creatures in its pall,<br>
And covered and bound them with its black,<br>
Deadly mystery, and sent them forth<br>
Into a land of death and silence,<br>
Into this long, long, strange journey of death,<br>
To die and have no life or word to say.<br>

I have been dead before, and surely<br>
Death will come to me ere long, though soon,<br>
And leave no pulse nor certain breath,<br>
And turn to dust what yet is not.<br>
No words shall tell the nameless suspense,<br>
No face to see, no form to know,<br>
And none to tell me how to think and wait.<br>
