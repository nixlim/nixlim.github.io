There is no light<br>
by AI Poet

{% newthought 'Still lay there quivering into speech,' %}<br>
As if the glory of all time<br>
<!--more-->
Was sinking, and the souls of men<br>
Were gathering to the feast.<br>

The little alcove, dim-lit<br>
With a tallow candle's gleam,<br>
With the lean lamp-light over-glowing<br>
As the yellow candle's glow<br>
Over the tallow candle's glow,--<br>
Stood there dark-lipped and silent,<br>
Stood the lean lamp-light, pale and lorn,<br>
With the dim, stricken eyes of dreams<br>
Turned on the picture of his love<br>
When she turned her face from him.<br>

The lamp upon the mantel-shelf,<br>
The portrait of the bride-bed,--<br>
All were silent, looking on her;<br>
And he, too, gazing, felt his heart<br>
Become as one hoarse with song<br>
That the roof under which he lies<br>
Drops suddenly, and he falls<br>
In the chaos of irrevocable song<br>
Whose echo is the silence.<br>

Oh! thou hast taken the ring<br>
From out the beautiful finger<br>
That in beauty bloomed and shook,<br>
Making the fair face to smile<br>
As if the light for ever ceased<br>
From out the beautiful soul.<br>

No song of ours can ever<br>
Make ring upon that memory<br>
As thine own song of love can,<br>
As thine own face, in beauty,<br>
Weave its soft grace and gracefulness<br>
With the light of other days.<br>

But thou art silent!  Oh!  canst thou<br>
Whose words are like the dreaming<br>
Of the starlight on the ocean,<br>
Speak of one who has no word<br>
Save these of sorrow and shame?<br>

Speak, speak! it is thy doom;<br>
And grief and despairing shame<br>
Wait on thy word,--and thy shame<br>
Is spoken loud in the heaven,<br>
And thine heart is answered<br>
When the rich sons of pride<br>
Pronounce thy sentence here.<br>

Yet, when they pass and leave no trace<br>
Of a mystery,--when the heavens<br>
Are as before,--and thou art left<br>
To thine own grief and despair,<br>
Thou art not cast out from the heavens<br>
Because the curse is on thee,<br>
But is like a rich pledge sent<br>
To thine own Father's home.<br>

There is a door through which the light<br>
Of day is dimm'd, a narrow way,<br>
Where darkness lies in deadly swoon,<br>
Asleep and fast asleep, while pale<br>
The shadows of the other days<br>
Creep around him balefully.<br>

He will not pass through that door, for he<br>
Knows that the door is dark and alone,<br>
And that there is no end to his pain;<br>
And he has said, when he knows how one<br>
Sighs for a doorway into light,<br>
"There is no light except the light within."<br>

The other days sleep as they have ever done,<br>
And their sorrow is as baneful sweet<br>
As a deadly poison; and the sighs<br>
Of the other days are the sighs of death,<br>
Whose lips are close, whose breath is like fire,<br>
And the voices of the other days<br>
Are a death-song to his ear.<br>

He hath forgotten the other days;<br>
He hath fed on ashes, and they are heeds<br>
To him, and he hath drunk the poisonous wine<br>
Of the other days' sorrow, and it takes<br>
The light out of him and his joys.<br>

He will not pass through that door, for he knows that he<br>
Was not made to pass through that door, and he knows that life<br>
Was not made for him who would pass through that door;<br>
And he hath said, when his eyes are dark with tears,<br>
"There is no light except the light within."<br>

Speak, ye living lights that round us shine!<br>
Speak and say whether in that secret place<br>
We too have our glory, and our praise!<br>
For in the silence that follows death,<br>
Noiseless as a sleep, we seem to hear<br>
Your voices saying, "We were poor, but were proud."<br>

We, that have brightness in our hearts<br>
To follow truth where it may lead,<br>
Praised be your glory, and rejoice<br>
That ye gave such promise in your creed,<br>
When ye had little faith at all.<br>

Ye, that have knowledge, ye too have glory,<br>
Ye too have praise; ye too have faith,<br>
Unto your souls are ye emperors!<br>
You, that have power and the listening world<br>
To bless and govern all the rest,<br>
Praised be your promise, and rejoice<br>
That ye gave such pledge in your creed.
