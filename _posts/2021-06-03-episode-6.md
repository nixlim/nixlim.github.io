THE CROWN<br>
by AI Poet

{% newthought 'By every breeze that blows,' %}<br>
There's music in the leaves,<br>
<!--more-->
And in the moss the sound<br>
Of a sweet voice and tabor-band,<br>
And, 'mid the eddies there,<br>
The echo of a song.<br>

Sweet soul! 'tis not in words,<br>
In tones, in zephyrs weak,<br>
To tell how sweet thou art,<br>
How beautiful thou art.<br>
But when the night-wind sighs<br>
Along the shadowy sway,<br>
And clouds of silence steal<br>
To hide the face of love,<br>

Then I can catch the heart<br>
Of evening, and reveal<br>
The face of peace, and praise<br>
Thy beauty, pure and rare,<br>
With love's wild ecstasy,<br>
In silent worship.<br>

TO-NIGHT, the star that shines so clear,<br>
The crown of evening on thy brow,<br>
The pearl of spring, to thee I dedicate<br>
All my heart, for thou hast given so much:<br>
Oh, whisper, borrow, steal, until<br>
I exhaust my store; borrow loud and late,<br>
For I am dying for thy sake.<br>

TO-NIGHT, the star that shines so clear,<br>

All my heart, for thou hast given so much:<br>
Oh, whisper, borrow, steal, until<br>
I exhaust my store; borrow loud and late,<br>
For I am dying for thy sake.<br>
