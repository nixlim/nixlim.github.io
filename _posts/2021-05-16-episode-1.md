### The Song of Wren{% sidenote 'One' 'This poem is named after the bird referred to in the poem'}

{% newthought 'By a fay-loved moon in the west' %},
And a kingdom for me at last.

I will fly where the bird is found
That is thought a jewel of white;
Where the bird plumes her wings in the dawn,
And to the morning makes song;
Where the bird, with down-dropt head,
Treads the teeming earth in her search,
And the bird is my love forever.

I will fly where the bird is found
That is moonlight to the sense;
Where the bird, by fathomless night,
Strikes, wakes, and sings a strain;
Where the bird flits, a wren in form,
Sickness and sleep in her breast,
And the bird is my love forever.

I will fly where the bird is found
That knows peace; where the bird brings
To sleep the thoughts of to-day;
Where the bird dies in her flight,
And a wisp of her soul remains;
And a rose-leaf from her grave
Is the rose I bend for ever.

Hark! the night winds in sport begin;
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;
The leaves drop from the appointed way,
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.
They fall, they fall, they fall;
Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall,
Down, down, down, down, down, down,
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,
Down to the everlasting shore,
From the beauteous things of earth that are,
To the things that are not,
To the kingdom of the taken up,
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,
To the place of the angels that guard us,
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,
To the place of feet of seraph feet,
Fell yesterday.

Hark! the night winds in sport begin;
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;
The leaves fall from the appointed way,
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,
Fell to the everlasting shore,
To the world of the taken up,
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,
To the place of the angels that guard us,
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,
To the place of feet of seraph feet,
Fell yesterday.

Sweet and low, sweet and low,
Wind of the western sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow,
Wind of the western sea!
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon, and blow,
Come from the dying moon, and blow;
Blow him again to me, that I may see
How the land lies quiet and supine,
Where the sea turns to stone, and the town
Cities of the vanishing foam.
