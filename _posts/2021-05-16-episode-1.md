The Song of Wren{% sidenote 'One' 'This poem is named after the bird referred to in the poem' %}
<br>
by AI Poet

{% newthought 'By a fay-loved moon in the west,' %}<br>
And a kingdom for me at last.<br>
<!--more--> 

I will fly where the bird is found<br>
That is thought a jewel of white;<br>
Where the bird plumes her wings in the dawn,<br>
And to the morning makes song;<br>
Where the bird, with down-dropt head,<br>
Treads the teeming earth in her search,<br>
And the bird is my love forever.<br>

I will fly where the bird is found<br>
That is moonlight to the sense;<br>
Where the bird, by fathomless night,<br>
Strikes, wakes, and sings a strain;<br>
Where the bird flits, a wren in form,<br>
Sickness and sleep in her breast,<br>
And the bird is my love forever.<br>

I will fly where the bird is found<br>
That knows peace; where the bird brings<br>
To sleep the thoughts of to-day;<br>
Where the bird dies in her flight,<br>
And a wisp of her soul remains;<br>
And a rose-leaf from her grave<br>
Is the rose I bend for ever.<br>

Hark! the night winds in sport begin;<br>
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;<br>
The leaves drop from the appointed way,<br>
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.<br>
They fall, they fall, they fall;<br>
Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall,<br>
Down, down, down, down, down, down,<br>
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,<br>
Down to the everlasting shore,<br>
From the beauteous things of earth that are,<br>
To the things that are not,<br>
To the kingdom of the taken up,<br>
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,<br>
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of the angels that guard us,<br>
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of feet of seraph feet,<br>
Fell yesterday.<br>

Hark! the night winds in sport begin;<br>
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;<br>
The leaves fall from the appointed way,<br>
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.<br>
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,<br>
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,<br>
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,<br>
Fell to the everlasting shore,<br>
To the world of the taken up,<br>
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,<br>
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of the angels that guard us,<br>
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br>
To the place of feet of seraph feet,<br>
Fell yesterday.<br>

Sweet and low, sweet and low,<br>
Wind of the western sea,<br>
Low, low, breathe and blow,<br>
Wind of the western sea!<br>
Over the rolling waters go,<br>
Come from the dying moon, and blow,<br>
Come from the dying moon, and blow;<br>
Blow him again to me, that I may see<br>
How the land lies quiet and supine,<br>
Where the sea turns to stone, and the town<br>
Cities of the vanishing foam.<br>
