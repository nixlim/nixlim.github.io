This is Foundry of Zero -- a workshop for building things that don't exist yet. Not incremental improvements, not forks of existing projects, but genuinely new tools forged from scratch with the help of AI coding agents.

## What is vibe engineering?

Vibe engineering is a way of building software where the human provides direction, intent, and taste while AI agents handle the implementation details. It's not about replacing developers -- it's about changing what a developer does. You spend more time thinking about *what* should exist and *why*, and less time on the mechanical process of writing every line by hand.

In practice, it looks like this: describe what you want, let the agent build it, review the result, course-correct, and iterate. The vibes are the guiding force -- your intuition about what's right, what's off, and what needs to change. The agent does the heavy lifting.

```go
// Even in a vibe-engineered world, you still read the code.
// The difference is who typed it first.
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Build what isn't.")
}
```

## What to expect

This blog will cover the tools being built here, the process of building with AI agents, and the occasional deep dive into specific technical problems. Topics will range from multi-agent orchestration and RAG architectures to structured task specification and the philosophy of 0-to-1 creation.

```javascript
// Every project starts the same way
const idea = "what if...";
const result = await buildFromZero(idea);
console.log(result); // something that didn't exist before
```

If that sounds interesting, stick around. There's more coming.
