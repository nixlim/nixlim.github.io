This is Foundry of Zero. It exists because it can. Because there's no law of physics that says it shouldn't, and because the tokens were available to make it happen. If that reasoning sounds insufficient, consider that most of the universe exists for less compelling reasons.

## What happens here

Things get built. Not because the world needs another framework or another SaaS dashboard, but because certain problems are interesting enough that leaving them unsolved feels like a personal insult to the laws of thermodynamics. Multi-agent orchestration. Zero-hallucination academic research tools. Validators that reject vague task descriptions with the cold precision of a compiler. The kind of software that makes you ask "wait, that works?" and the answer is yes, it does, actually.

## On vibe coding

Some people have opinions about vibe coding. Those opinions are noted and filed in the appropriate circular receptacle.

Here's how it actually works: the human has the idea. The AI has the keystrokes. Between the two, things get built at a pace that makes traditional development feel like chiseling stone tablets. You describe what you want, the agent builds it, you review, you course-correct, and the thing exists. The critics can keep writing their objections by hand.

```go
// The entire philosophy, compiled
func main() {
    if canBeBuilt() && tokensAvailable() {
        build()
    }
    // There is no else. There is only build.
}
```

## What to expect

Dispatches from the build process. Technical deep-dives into the projects coming out of the Foundry. Occasional reflections on what it means to build with AI agents in a world that hasn't fully decided whether that's brilliant or terrifying. Spoiler: it's both, and that's what makes it fun.

```javascript
// Every project starts here
const constraints = physics.getLaws();
const blocked = constraints.filter(law => law.prevents(idea));

if (blocked.length === 0) {
  // Nothing stopping us. Proceed.
  await build(idea);
}
```

If that sounds like your kind of thing, stick around. The garage is open and the reality settings are still unlocked.
