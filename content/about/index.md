## The Foundry

Foundry of Zero is where things get built because they can be. Because there are no laws of physics preventing them to be built and because tokens are available to do so. Foundry of Zero is a testament to complete and full adoption of vibe coding as a philosophy, to the chagrin of the naysayers, the doubters, the hubriant.

The Foundry of Zero is a garage where the universe accidentally left its reality settings unlocked. A place where things exist not because they should, but because no one remembered to toggle off the "Why Not?" flag in the laws of physics config file.

## The Builder

NiXLiM. Developer, tinkerer, builder of things.

## The Philosophy

Somewhere along the way, software development became a game of copying homework. Someone builds a thing. A thousand people fork it, slap a new logo on it, and call it innovation. The world drowns in marginally different todo apps while genuinely weird, interesting problems go untouched because "that's not how it's done."

The Foundry doesn't care how it's done. The Foundry cares whether it *can* be done. And if no law of physics explicitly forbids it, that's a green light. Every project here starts at zero -- not because starting from scratch is noble, but because the interesting stuff lives in the territory that NiXLiM has not mapped yet or forked yet. 

## Vibe Coding

Call it what you want. Vibe coding. Vibe engineering. Prompt-driven development. The point is simple: the human has the idea, the AI has the keystrokes, and between the two of them, things get built that would've taken one person months or simply never happened at all.

This is not a compromise. This is not "AI-assisted" with air quotes. This is full, unapologetic, all-in vibe coding -- the human sets the direction, the agents build the thing, and the naysayers can write their objections by hand if they prefer. The results speak for themselves: real tools, real code, real functionality, built at a pace that makes traditional development look like it's running on dial-up.

The doubters will catch up eventually. Or they won't. Either way, things are getting built here.
