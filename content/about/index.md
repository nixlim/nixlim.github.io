## The Foundry

Foundry of Zero is where things get built from scratch. Not forks, not templates, not incremental improvements on existing solutions. Every project here starts at zero and is forged into something that didn't exist before.

The name says it: zero is the starting point. Not one, not ten, not "let's take this existing thing and tweak it." Zero. The foundry is where raw ideas get shaped into real, working tools.

## The Builder

NiXLiM. Developer, tinkerer, builder of things.

## The Philosophy

Most software is derivative. Someone builds something, and a thousand people build slightly different versions of the same thing. That's fine -- the world needs iteration. But it also needs creation. Genuine 0-to-1 work where you look at a problem and build something that nobody else has built yet.

That's what happens here. Every project in the Foundry is a bet that a particular idea is worth exploring from first principles, without the safety net of existing implementations to copy from.

## Vibe Engineering

The tools here are built using what some call "vibe engineering" -- a development practice where the human provides the vision, direction, and taste while AI coding agents handle the implementation. It's not about removing the human from the loop. It's about changing what the human does in the loop.

You think about architecture. You set constraints. You review, course-correct, and iterate. The AI does the typing. The vibes -- your intuition about what's right and what's wrong -- guide the process. The result is software that gets built faster without sacrificing the thoughtfulness that good engineering requires.
