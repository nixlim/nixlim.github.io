It exists because it can. Because there&amp;rsquo;s no law of physics that says it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and because the tokens were available to make it happen. If that reasoning sounds insufficient, consider that most of the universe exists for less compelling reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-happens-here"&gt;What happens here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things get built. Not because the world needs another framework or another SaaS dashboard, but because certain problems are interesting enough that leaving them unsolved feels like a personal insult to the laws of thermodynamics. Multi-agent orchestration. Zero-hallucination academic research tools. Validators that reject vague task descriptions with the cold precision of a compiler. The kind of software that makes you ask &amp;ldquo;wait, that works?&amp;rdquo; and the answer is yes, it does, actually.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
