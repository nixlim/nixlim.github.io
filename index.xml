Instead of a single agent working sequentially, Hive distributes work across a pool of agents, each operating in isolated git worktrees to prevent conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture revolves around a supervisor process that decomposes high-level objectives into discrete tasks, assigns them to available agents based on role, and manages the integration of completed work back into the main branch. Each agent gets its own worktree and operates independently, with bead-based issue tracking providing the coordination layer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Academic Quote Extractor</title><link>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/academic-quote-extractor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/academic-quote-extractor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Academic Quote Extractor (AQE) is a CLI tool built on a hybrid RAG architecture that extracts relevant quotes from academic papers and generates properly formatted Harvard citations. The pipeline operates in three phases: ingest, extract, and export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical design decision is the zero-hallucination guarantee. The LLM (Claude) is never asked to generate or paraphrase quotes. Instead, it only scores the relevance of pre-retrieved passages. Quotes are always retrieved verbatim from SQLite, ensuring every citation traces back to exact source text. This eliminates the most dangerous failure mode of LLM-assisted research: fabricated references.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OpenCode Beads Plugin</title><link>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/opencode-beads-plugin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/opencode-beads-plugin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The OpenCode Beads Plugin bridges the &lt;code&gt;bd&lt;/code&gt; (beads) CLI issue tracker with OpenCode&amp;rsquo;s plugin system, giving AI coding agents automatic awareness of project issues and workflow context. It&amp;rsquo;s an event-driven integration that hooks into three key moments of an OpenCode session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;session.created&lt;/code&gt;, the plugin runs &lt;code&gt;bd prime&lt;/code&gt; to inject workflow context into the agent&amp;rsquo;s initial prompt &amp;ndash; giving it full awareness of available issues, priorities, and the project&amp;rsquo;s task management conventions. During &lt;code&gt;session.compacting&lt;/code&gt;, it re-injects this context to prevent loss during context window compression. On &lt;code&gt;session.idle&lt;/code&gt;, it triggers &lt;code&gt;bd sync&lt;/code&gt; to ensure issue state stays in sync with git.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Task Templating</title><link>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/task-templating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundryofzero.ai/projects/task-templating/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Natural language task descriptions are ambiguous. When an AI coding agent encounters gaps in a specification, it fills them with assumptions &amp;ndash; assumptions that often diverge from the developer&amp;rsquo;s intent, causing rework and defects. Task Templating addresses this with a machine-readable structured task format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format (defined in &lt;code&gt;STRUCTURED_TEMPLATE_SPEC.md&lt;/code&gt;) requires explicit fields for every dimension of a task: &lt;code&gt;TASK_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TASK_NAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GOAL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INPUTS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OUTPUTS&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ACCEPTANCE&lt;/code&gt; criteria are mandatory. Contextual fields like &lt;code&gt;DEPENDS_ON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CONSTRAINTS&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;FILES_SCOPE&lt;/code&gt; force the author to think through dependencies and boundaries. The result is a specification that leaves no room for interpretation &amp;ndash; if a field is empty, the task isn&amp;rsquo;t ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hello, World</title><link>https://foundryofzero.ai/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundryofzero.ai/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is Foundry of Zero &amp;ndash; a workshop for building things that don&amp;rsquo;t exist yet. Not incremental improvements, not forks of existing projects, but genuinely new tools forged from scratch with the help of AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-vibe-engineering"&gt;What is vibe engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibe engineering is a way of building software where the human provides direction, intent, and taste while AI agents handle the implementation details. It&amp;rsquo;s not about replacing developers &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s about changing what a developer does. You spend more time thinking about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; should exist and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, and less time on the mechanical process of writing every line by hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://foundryofzero.ai/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundryofzero.ai/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-foundry"&gt;The Foundry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundry of Zero is where things get built from scratch. Not forks, not templates, not incremental improvements on existing solutions. Every project here starts at zero and is forged into something that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name says it: zero is the starting point. Not one, not ten, not &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s take this existing thing and tweak it.&amp;rdquo; Zero. The foundry is where raw ideas get shaped into real, working tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
