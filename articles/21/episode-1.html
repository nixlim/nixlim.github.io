<p>The Song of Wren<label for="One" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="One" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A theme of imitation of bird’s experience is woven into the poem, quite consistently. The AI uses the actual behavioural characteristics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren"><em>wren</em></a>, to describe the actions taken by the bird </span>
<br />
by AI Poet</p>

<p><span class="newthought">By a fay-loved moon in the west,</span> <br />
And a kingdom for me at last.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>I will fly where the bird is found<br />
That is thought a jewel of white;<br />
Where the bird plumes her wings in the dawn,<br />
And to the morning makes song<label for="Two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Wrens are known for their singing, as Wikipedia notes: <em>Wrens have loud and often complex songs, sometimes given in duet by a pair. The songs of members of the genera Cyphorhinus and Microcerculus have been considered especially pleasant to the human ear, leading to common names such as song wren, musician wren, flutist wren, and southern nightingale-wren</em> </span>;<br />
Where the bird, with down-dropt head,<br />
Treads the teeming earth in her search<label for="Three" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Three" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Wrens are primarily insectivorous, running around the ground in search of insects. Hence, the use of <em>treads</em> in the verse is particularly on point. </span>,<br />
And the bird is my love forever.<br /></p>

<p>I will fly where the bird is found<br />
That is moonlight to the sense;<br />
Where the bird, by fathomless night,<br />
Strikes, wakes, and sings a strain;<br />
Where the bird flits, a wren in form<label for="Four" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Four" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A direct reference to wren </span>,<br />
Sickness and sleep in her breast,<br />
And the bird is my love forever.<br /></p>

<p>I will fly where the bird is found<br />
That knows peace; where the bird brings<br />
To sleep the thoughts of to-day;<br />
Where the bird dies in her flight,<br />
And a wisp of her soul remains;<br />
And a rose-leaf from her grave<br />
Is the rose I bend for ever.<br /></p>

<p>Hark! the night winds in sport begin;<br />
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;<br />
The leaves drop from the appointed way,<br />
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.<br />
They fall, they fall, they fall;<br />
Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall,<br />
Down, down, down, down, down, down,<label for="Five" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Five" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This passage evokes a feeling of flying </span><br />
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,<br />
Down to the everlasting shore,<br />
From the beauteous things of earth that are,<br />
To the things that are not,<br />
To the kingdom of the taken up,<br />
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,<br />
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of the angels that guard us,<br />
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of feet of seraph feet,<br />
Fell yesterday.<br /></p>

<p>Hark! the night winds in sport begin;<br />
The bird flies forth in pent tempest flight;<br />
The leaves fall from the appointed way,<br />
As fleecy clouds do drop from high.<br />
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,<br />
Fell, fell, fell, fell, fell, fell,<label for="Six" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Six" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This passage evokes a feeling of flying </span><br />
From the thorny bloom of red and gold,<br />
Fell to the everlasting shore,<br />
To the world of the taken up,<br />
To the world of the spirits and the shadow of the spirits,<br />
To the place of the angels of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of the angels that guard us,<br />
To the place of the seraphim of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of the feet of glory and beauty,<br />
To the place of feet of seraph feet,<br />
Fell yesterday.<br /></p>

<p>Sweet and low, sweet and low,<br />
Wind of the western sea,<br />
Low, low, breathe and blow,<br />
Wind of the western sea!<br />
Over the rolling waters go,<br />
Come from the dying moon, and blow,<br />
Come from the dying moon, and blow;<br />
Blow him again to me, that I may see<br />
How the land lies quiet and supine,<br />
Where the sea turns to stone, and the town<br />
Cities of the vanishing foam<label for="Seven" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Seven" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The first six verses come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_and_Low_(poem)">Sweet and Low</a>, a poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> It is interesting that the last three verses, which are AI generated, evoke an images of subjucation of nature by <em>civilization sprawl</em> (<strong>Where the sea turns to stone</strong>), and <em>population explosion</em> (<strong>and the town [into] Cities of the vanishing foam</strong>) </span>.<br /></p>
