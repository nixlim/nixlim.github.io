<p>There is no light<br />
by AI Poet</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Still lay there quivering into speech,</span> <br />
As if the glory of all time<br />
<!--more-->
Was sinking, and the souls of men<br />
Were gathering to the feast.<br /></p>

<p>The little alcove, dim-lit<br />
With a tallow candle’s gleam,<br />
With the lean lamp-light over-glowing<br />
As the yellow candle’s glow<br />
Over the tallow candle’s glow,–<br />
Stood there dark-lipped and silent,<br />
Stood the lean lamp-light, pale and lorn,<br />
With the dim, stricken eyes of dreams<br />
Turned on the picture of his love<br />
When she turned her face from him.<br /></p>

<p>The lamp upon the mantel-shelf,<br />
The portrait of the bride-bed,–<br />
All were silent, looking on her;<br />
And he, too, gazing, felt his heart<br />
Become as one hoarse with song<br />
That the roof under which he lies<br />
Drops suddenly, and he falls<br />
In the chaos of irrevocable song<br />
Whose echo is the silence.<br /></p>

<p>Oh! thou hast taken the ring<br />
From out the beautiful finger<br />
That in beauty bloomed and shook,<br />
Making the fair face to smile<br />
As if the light for ever ceased<br />
From out the beautiful soul.<br /></p>

<p>No song of ours can ever<br />
Make ring upon that memory<br />
As thine own song of love can,<br />
As thine own face, in beauty,<br />
Weave its soft grace and gracefulness<br />
With the light of other days.<br /></p>

<p>But thou art silent!  Oh!  canst thou<br />
Whose words are like the dreaming<br />
Of the starlight on the ocean,<br />
Speak of one who has no word<br />
Save these of sorrow and shame?<br /></p>

<p>Speak, speak! it is thy doom;<br />
And grief and despairing shame<br />
Wait on thy word,–and thy shame<br />
Is spoken loud in the heaven,<br />
And thine heart is answered<br />
When the rich sons of pride<br />
Pronounce thy sentence here.<br /></p>

<p>Yet, when they pass and leave no trace<br />
Of a mystery,–when the heavens<br />
Are as before,–and thou art left<br />
To thine own grief and despair,<br />
Thou art not cast out from the heavens<br />
Because the curse is on thee,<br />
But is like a rich pledge sent<br />
To thine own Father’s home.<br /></p>

<p>There is a door through which the light<br />
Of day is dimm’d, a narrow way,<br />
Where darkness lies in deadly swoon,<br />
Asleep and fast asleep, while pale<br />
The shadows of the other days<br />
Creep around him balefully.<br /></p>

<p>He will not pass through that door, for he<br />
Knows that the door is dark and alone,<br />
And that there is no end to his pain;<br />
And he has said, when he knows how one<br />
Sighs for a doorway into light,<br />
“There is no light except the light within.”<br /></p>

<p>The other days sleep as they have ever done,<br />
And their sorrow is as baneful sweet<br />
As a deadly poison; and the sighs<br />
Of the other days are the sighs of death,<br />
Whose lips are close, whose breath is like fire,<br />
And the voices of the other days<br />
Are a death-song to his ear.<br /></p>

<p>He hath forgotten the other days;<br />
He hath fed on ashes, and they are heeds<br />
To him, and he hath drunk the poisonous wine<br />
Of the other days’ sorrow, and it takes<br />
The light out of him and his joys.<br /></p>

<p>He will not pass through that door, for he knows that he<br />
Was not made to pass through that door, and he knows that life<br />
Was not made for him who would pass through that door;<br />
And he hath said, when his eyes are dark with tears,<br />
“There is no light except the light within.”<br /></p>

<p>Speak, ye living lights that round us shine!<br />
Speak and say whether in that secret place<br />
We too have our glory, and our praise!<br />
For in the silence that follows death,<br />
Noiseless as a sleep, we seem to hear<br />
Your voices saying, “We were poor, but were proud.”<br /></p>

<p>We, that have brightness in our hearts<br />
To follow truth where it may lead,<br />
Praised be your glory, and rejoice<br />
That ye gave such promise in your creed,<br />
When ye had little faith at all.<br /></p>

<p>Ye, that have knowledge, ye too have glory,<br />
Ye too have praise; ye too have faith,<br />
Unto your souls are ye emperors!<br />
You, that have power and the listening world<br />
To bless and govern all the rest,<br />
Praised be your promise, and rejoice<br />
That ye gave such pledge in your creed.</p>
